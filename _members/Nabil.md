My research efforts focus on developing data analytic methods and systems to quantify and model behaviors through cutting-edge passive sensing technologies. My lab conducts research developing these systems and methods to understand, detect, predict and ultimately prevent behavioral risk factors (obesity, poor diet, and physical inactivity). I collaborate closely with behavioral intervention researchers in order to design theoretically useful personalized and generalized models, sensors and systems for evidence-based practice.
